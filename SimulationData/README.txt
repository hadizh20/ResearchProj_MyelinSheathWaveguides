This folder contains all the simulation data recorded at the monitors within the simulation region. The monitors are located every 25 micrometers along the z axis, from z = 25 to z = 500 inclusive. 

The Lumerical scripts used to save this data for a given monitor are also included here. Variable names have not been changed from their names within the simulation software (e.g., Lumerical uses E to denote electric field, MATLAB variable to contain this data is also named E).
