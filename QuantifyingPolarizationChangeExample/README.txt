This folder includes the start of a MATLAB script. It loads two data files (also saved here) from cross-sections z = 75 and z = 125 in the model, and begins to perform operations needed to calculate the overlap integral metric as has been suggested to quantify polarization change between cross-sections. See ``MyelinSheathWaveguides_GuideToCodeAndSimulationData_EF.pdf'' for more information.
