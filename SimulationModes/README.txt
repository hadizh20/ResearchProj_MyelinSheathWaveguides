This folder contains all simulation data recorded for the calculated modes of the myelinated axon model cross-section, labelled by the mode. "mode1" contains the saved data for the first mode, and so on.  

"GeneratingFigures" is a folder containing MATLAB code which was used to generate the magnitude plot and vector plot of each mode, and the images it generates which are good copies used for the paper. 

"READ_SOURCE_DATA_final.txt" is the Lumerical script file to save all the data from the mode source is also included.

"ModeInfoNB.txt" is a text file which includes all the data that was presented alongside calculation of the mode in the software, most notably this includes the effective index which is analogous to the eigenvalue of the mode.
