# ResearchProj_MyelinSheathWaveguides
Research project investigating polarization evolution and transmission of myelin sheath waveguides. This repository contains simulation data and other relevant files.

Please refer to ``ImportantDocuments/MyelinSheathWaveguides_GuideToCodeAndSimulationData.pdf'' for further instructions.

Hadi: Before adding other collaborators and/or making this repository public, I strongly recommend you archive this repository -- i.e., make it read-only. As well, before making the repository public, I also recommend removing the paper and supplemental drafts (and perhaps the guide to the code and data) from the ``ImportantDocuments'' folder.
