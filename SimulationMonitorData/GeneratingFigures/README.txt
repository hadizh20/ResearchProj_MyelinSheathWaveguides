This folder contains the MATLAB code used to generate the figures depicting the electric field profile (pair of magnitude and vector plots) at each monitor. It also contains the code used to generate the transmission plot.

All good copy plots generated by these two code files are also saved here, each in their own folder (magnitude, vector, transmission).
