This folder contains the MATLAB code written to generate the matrix transform which was input into the Lumerical software, used to specify that the birefringence of the myelin is radial birefringence.

The file "importing_grid_attribute.txt" is the Lumerical script (saved as a text file) that will take the matrix transform data file ("custom_matrix_transform_FINAL\UData_myelinRad1_res801.mat" and input it into the Lumerical software appropriately. This grid attribute will apply a coordinate transformation of Cartesian to cylindrical within the myelin sheath cross-section region.
