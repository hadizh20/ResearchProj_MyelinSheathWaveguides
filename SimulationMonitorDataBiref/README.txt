This folder contains all the birefringent simulation data recorded at the monitors within the simulation region. The first monitor is located at z = 25, and they are spaced 25 micrometers apart until z = 500.

Also included is the Lumerical script used to save the simulation data to the MATLAB files.

Also included is a folder for the code to generate the figures, and the good copy figures themselves.

NOTE: These are all results for the birefringent case that we did not use in the paper.
